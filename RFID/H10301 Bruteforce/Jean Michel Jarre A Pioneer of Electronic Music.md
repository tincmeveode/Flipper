He also performed a special piece called Rendez-Vous IV with astronaut Ron McNair playing saxophone from space, but the plan was cancelled due to the tragedy.
- The Destination Docklands concert (1988): This was Jarre's most ambitious and complex concert to date. He transformed the Royal Victoria Dock in London into a futuristic cityscape with giant cranes, scaffolding, water screens and fireworks.
