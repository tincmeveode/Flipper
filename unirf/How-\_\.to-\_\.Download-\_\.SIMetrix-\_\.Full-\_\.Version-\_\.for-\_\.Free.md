If you want to download SIMetrix full version for free, you might be tempted to search for keywords like "simetrixfullversionfreedownload" on the web. However, this is not a good idea, because you might end up with malware, viruses, or illegal copies that could harm your computer or violate the license agreement.
 
The good news is that there is a legitimate way to download SIMetrix full version for free, and that is by using the SIMetrix/SIMPLIS Elements version. This is a free-to-download version of the software that offers full schematic capture and waveform viewing/analysis capability along with a host of documentation and training materials designed to help users get up-to-speed quickly with SIMetrix/SIMPLIS' simulation capabilities[^2^].
 
The latest version of SIMetrix/SIMPLIS Elements is v8.50i, released on June 8th, 2022. You can download it from the official website[^2^]. Elements is a free version of the program with no license or copying restrictions. Virtually all features of the full production version are enabled except some advanced features that require a command line, user scripts, Verilog-A compiler, Verilog-HDL mixed signal simulation, custom menu and key definitions, PSpice translator, SPICE3 raw file import, Safe Operating Area testing, menu/key editor, and encrypted models[^2^].
 
However, there are some circuit size limits that apply to the Elements version. For example, you can have no more than 15 state variables, 10 capacitors or inductors combined, six switches or logic gates each, 26 states, and 100 new topologies for SIMPLIS simulations[^2^]. For SIMetrix simulations, you can have no more than 140 analog nodes, 360 digital nodes, 720 digital ports, 300 digital components, and 360 digital outputs[^2^]. These limits are generous enough for most personal, educational and business use cases.
 
If you want to unlock some of the disabled features or remove the circuit size limits for 30 days, you can use the unlock feature by going to menu Help | Unlock Features...[^1^]. This will allow you to try out the full capabilities of SIMetrix/SIMPLIS before deciding whether to purchase a full license or not.
 
In conclusion, SIMetrix/SIMPLIS Elements is a great way to download SIMetrix full version for free legally and safely. It offers most of the features and functionality of the full production version with some reasonable limitations. You can also unlock some of the disabled features or remove the circuit size limits for 30 days using the unlock feature. To download SIMetrix/SIMPLIS Elements, visit the official website[^2^] and enjoy simulating your circuits!

Some of the benefits of using SIMetrix/SIMPLIS for circuit design and simulation are:
 
- It supports both analog and digital circuits, as well as mixed-signal and power electronics circuits.
- It offers two fast and powerful simulators: SIMetrix for enhanced SPICE simulation and SIMPLIS for switching power simulation.
- It provides a fully integrated development environment with schematic editor, waveform viewer, scripting system, optimizer, and more.
- It includes advanced features for IC design, such as Verilog-A, Verilog-HDL, BSIM3 models, device binning, process corner selection, transient snapshots, real-time noise analysis, etc[^1^] [^2^].
- It offers flexible licensing options, such as portable, LAN, and WAN licenses[^3^].
- It has a high-quality customer support service and a large user community.
